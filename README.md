This code simulates a smart self-healing power distribution system using the IEEE 33-bus network. It loads real household electricity data, builds the network with residential loads and DERs (solar and wind), and runs a 24-hour simulation. Faults are injected at set hours, and the system detects them using voltage drops and performs self-healing by closing a tie-switch. It also includes simulated communication delays and evaluates performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Graphs are generated to show voltage, load, DER output, faults, losses, and delay profiles—demonstrating the system’s adaptive response.
